# product-inventory-management-system
Develop a RESTful API service for a product inventory management system using Golang.    
     
## Overview
This is a simple RESTful API service for managing product inventory, 
developed in Golang using the MVC pattern. 
The system is built with the [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) framework 
and [GORM](https://gorm.io/) for ORM (Object-Relational Mapping). 
It allows users to add, update, delete, and retrieve product information. 
The product data is stored in a [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) database, 
ensuring performance and reliability with proper database handling techniques 
such as connection pooling, transactions, and error handling.    

## Features
* Login: Authenticate users to generate a JWT token. Use this token to access other protected API endpoints.
     * The others are protected routes, meaning a valid JWT token must be provided in the request headers.
* Home: This endpoint welcomes authenticated users to the Product API.
* Create Product: Add a new product to the inventory.
* Retrieve Products: Get details of *all products* or a *specific product by ID.*
* Update Product: Modify details of an existing product.
* Delete Product: Remove a product from the inventory.

## API Endpoints

#### 1. Login
* Endpoint: POST /login/:user
* Response:
```
{
"token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VybmFtZSI6ImFkbWluIiwiZXhwIjoxNzI0NzczNDEyfQ.rADyiQUIKj_nhVePIVVKOE0YHItcErz2Df_d9sL5sKI"
}
```
* Authorization:
Mechanism: JWT (JSON Web Token)
Middleware: The APIs under the /protected group are secured using JWT authentication. 
You must include a valid JWT token in the request header as a Bearer token.
* Request Header Example:
```
"Authorization": "<your-jwt-token>"
```
#### 2. Home
* Endpoint: GET /protected/
* Response:
```
{
  "Welcome to the Product API"
}

```
#### 3. Create Product
* Endpoint: POST /products
* Request Body:
```
{
  "name": "Product Name",
  "price": 100.0
}
```
* Response:
  * 201 Created: Product created successfully.
  * 400 Bad Request: Invalid input data.
  * 500 Internal Server Error: Database error.
     
#### 4. Retrieve All Products
* Endpoint: GET /products
* Response:
  * 200 OK: List of products.
  * 500 Internal Server Error: Database error.
      
#### 5. Retrieve Product by ID
* Endpoint: GET /products/{id}
* Response:
  * 200 OK: Product details.
  * 404 Not Found: Product not found.
  * 500 Internal Server Error: Database error.   
     
#### 6. Update Product
* Endpoint: PUT /products/{id}
* Request Body:
```
{
  "name": "Updated Product Name",
  "price": 120.0
}
```
#### 7. Delete Product
* Endpoint: DELETE /products/{id}
* Response:
  * 200 OK: Product deleted successfully.
  * 404 Not Found: Product not found.
  * 500 Internal Server Error: Database error.
 
## Database Schema
* Table Name: `products`
* Columns:
  * id: Integer (Primary Key, Auto Increment)
  * name: String
  * price: Float
* Sample SQL Script
```
CREATE TABLE products (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    price FLOAT NOT NULL
);
```
* Model Migration
In the Go application, 
the Product model is automatically migrated to the database schema 
using GORM's AutoMigrate method. 
This ensures that the products table is created and kept up-to-date 
based on the current Product model definition.
```
db.AutoMigrate(&Product{})
```
This migration process handles creating the table 
if it doesnâ€™t exist and updating the schema as necessary, 
based on changes to the Product model.
